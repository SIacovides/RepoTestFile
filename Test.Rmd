## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# to add a picture/image
![figlegend](name of pic but must be in same folder as that which working on)

#to add plot of normal distribution of 1000 samples
foo <- rnorm(1000)

# to add histaogram
![](hist.png)

# to add a website
[name of link](insert weblink i.e. http....)

# NB all coding happens in the chunk! I.e need to insert ```{r} and write codes then end chunk ```{r} . 
# To add n image or weside, to change heading size etc, all do outside of chunks - to do this size 1 header = #Header, size 2 = ##Header, etc..until Header size 6 (start all headers with #, but ouside of chunk)

#can also write normally under the header in: _italics_ or **bold** etc 

# then can add new chunk: ```{r newchunk}
plot (foo, col = 'blue')
point(bar, col = 'green')
boxplot (foo)

baz <- data,frame(data = foo, 
                  name = (rep(c('A', 'B'), 500)),
                  size = rbinom(1000, size = 1, prob = 0.5))

# to just print some just wrire name- e.g. to pint foo, just type foo on a seperate line.
boxplot(baz$size ~ baz$name)
